<strong>What happens if I have a car out on rent that gets recalled?</strong> </br>
At Payless Car Rental, the safety of our customers and employees is of great concern. Our policies and procedures regarding the handling of vehicles that are the subject of a manufacturer's recall notice is a prime example of how we put our customers' safety first.

Periodically, automobile manufacturers provide notices of issues relating to their vehicles. These notices range from minor issues to recall notices relating to vehicles that may pose a risk to the safety of the driver, passengers and the general public.
 </br>
In the United States, when we receive a safety recall notice from a vehicle manufacturer under the Motor Vehicle Safety Act, we identify the affected vehicles in our fleet and place them on a "hard hold" in our reservations system, which prevents them from being rented. We then do not rent these a vehicle until we are able to implement a remedy that has been approved by the manufacturer and the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration (NHTSA).
 </br>
In addition, when our vehicles become subject to a safety recall, we use a third-party vendor that automatically calls customers within 24 hours when we have confirmed that the vehicle they have out on rent has been recalled. This process is used to contact all customers who have provided a telephone number and/or email address during the reservation or check-in process through which the customer can be reached. Each customer who has rented a vehicle that is subsequently subject to a recall will receive a message providing specific instructions as to how, where and when the vehicle may be returned for an exchange. If no valid telephone number has been provided, a written notice will be sent to the renter's residential address.
