          All other disputes are Non-Web Site Disputes. Any claim arising from your purchase of a Payless Product or Service is a Non-Web Site Dispute. Any claim arising from the content of any offer or advertisement on the Web Site is a Non-Web Site Dispute.
          <br>
          WEB SITE DISPUTES â PRE-DISPUTE RESOLUTION 
          Before filing a lawsuit in connection with any Web Site Dispute (including, but not limited to, in an individual arbitration or in a small claims proceeding), you and Payless agree that we shall give the other party written notice of the claim to be asserted 30 days before initiating a proceeding and make a reasonable good faith effort to resolve the claim. If you are intending to assert a claim against Payless, you must send the written notice of the claim to Attention: Payless Car Rental, Inc., 6 Sylvan Way, Parsippany, New Jersey, 07054 Attn: Legal Department. If Payless is intending to assert a claim against you, we will send the written notice of the claim to you at your address appearing in our records. NO SETTLEMENT DEMAND OR SETTLEMENT OFFER USED IN THIS PREDISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS MAY BE USED IN ANY PROCEEDING, INCLUDING AS EVIDENCE OR AS AN ADMISSION OF ANY LIABILITY OR DAMAGES (OR LACK THEREOF).
          <br>
          WEB SITE DISPUTE RESOLUTION -- VENUE 
          You agree to be subject to the jurisdiction of New Jersey for any Web Site Dispute. You agree that any Web Site Dispute will be resolved in New Jersey to the exclusion of any other potential venue.
          <br>
          WEB SITE DISPUTE RESOLUTION â ARBITRATION, JURY TRIAL WAIVER 
          Neither you nor we will be able to sue in court in connection with a Web Site Dispute. All Web Site Disputes must be resolved through individual (non-class) arbitration. You indicate your acceptance to these Terms, including this agreement to arbitrate, by continuing to use the Web Site after having the opportunity to review these Terms. 
          <br>
          You and Payless intend for this to be an agreement for arbitration that can be enforced under both the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 1â16, and the New Jersey Arbitration Act (NJAA), N.J.S.A. 2A:23Bâ1 to â32.
          <br>
          You and Payless waive any rights to maintain other available resolution processes for Web Site Disputes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle disputes. You and Payless waive any right to a jury trial for Web Site Disputes.
          <br>
          Instead of suing in court, we each agree to settle Web Site Disputes only by arbitration. The rules in arbitration are different. There's no judge or jury, and review is limited, but an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief, and must honor the same limitations stated in the agreement as a court would.
          <br>
          Any Web Site Dispute shall be determined by arbitration in New Jersey before one arbitrator(s). The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/. Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. If for any reason, JAMS cannot or will not provide this arbitration, the parties may ask any court of competent jurisdiction to select an arbitrator from a list provided by the parties. 
          <br>
          To the extent a party commences any action with includes both Web Site Disputes and Non-Web Site Disputes, consideration of the Non-Web Site Disputes shall be stayed until the Web Site Disputes are fully arbitrated. Then, any Web Site Disputes will be considered by any court of competent jurisdiction. 
          <br>
          If you are an individual (instead of, for instance, a partnership, corporation, or other form of entity or non-natural person), in the event that (1) your claim is less than $10,000, and (2) you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, Payless will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation.
          <br>
          WEB SITE DISPUTE RESOLUTION - NO CLASS ACTIONS 
          You agree that you will not file a class action against Payless or its Providers, or participate in a class action against Payless or its Providers, in any Web Site Dispute. You agree that you will not file or seek a class arbitration, or participate in a class arbitration against Payless or its Providers, in any Web Site Dispute.
          <br>
          SEVERANCE OF INVALID TERMS 
          If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if the class action waiver of these Terms is deemed unenforceable, the agreement of the parties to engage in arbitration shall likewise be deemed stricken. 
          ENTIRE AGREEMENT 
          The provisions and conditions of these Terms, and each obligation referenced herein, represent the entire Agreement between Payless with respect to your use of this free Web Site, its affiliated or related entities, and you, and supersede any prior agreements or understandings not incorporated herein. In the event that any inconsistencies exist between these Terms and any future published terms of use or understanding, the last published Terms or terms of use or understanding shall prevail.
